## Next steps

### Validation
Since the requirements of this project were clear about do not waste time implementing validations, 
it was not done, but it is really important to have.

### Support more currency's
Should be nice to have the additional prices and rebate in other currencys and calculate the prices 
according to the right currency.

### Calculate as a Service
One good next step should be to implement a REST API that could called by any service and caclulate 
the price in the right way.
